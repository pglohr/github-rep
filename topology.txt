For me, goal of this course is to start using automation on harware I use
Most tasks are configuration one and my lab, at least at the beginning, is a set of varous devices not necessarly connected between them
Devices ready to use are:
1. Firewall Paloalto PA-220 (physical)
2. Virtual cisco routers using EVE-ng
3. Virtual F5 LTM running on VMware
Another goal is also to try to understand how git is working
